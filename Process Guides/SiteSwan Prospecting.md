## Tips

* SiteSwan:
  * Zoom out to fit all results on one screen for easier clicking and highlighting
  * Downloaded CSV file isn't as useful as the method above
* LibreOffice:
  * Background Color dropdown has a "Recent Colors" section, use it for consistent highlighting
  * Freeze the first row for easy reference after scrolling -- View > Freeze Cells > First Row
  * Select all content, and click `Wrap Text` button twice to remove line wrapping
  * After removing line wrapping, apply optimal row height and column width to clean up appearance

# Email Campaigns (SS)

How to create and send an email using the SecondStreet platform.

## Update Ongoing & Upcoming Emails

Unfortunately, SecondStreet doesn't allow active campaigns to be changed.  Instead, they need to be cloned, updated, and rescheduled.

1. Login to [SecondStreet](https://partners.secondstreet.com/p/app/#/login)
2. Depending on the update, images may need to be resized
   1. Recommend using photoshop, note that email's max-width is 600px
3. First get the old email ready to discard, open it's editor screen
   1. Copy the campaign name, then append it with `(OLD)`
   2. Back in the email screen, `Copy` the old campaign to a new draft
4. Now in the new email:
   1. Paste the campaign name copied from the old email
   2. Make necessary changes
   3. Reschedule, time and dates should carry over, so double check first
   4. Send a test to make sure email looks good
   5. Finalize the campaign and save (should move it to "Ongoing & Upcoming")
5. Archive old campaign

# Programming Exercise Checklist

The purpose of this list is to provide a structured way of tracking each exercise in the book "Exercises for Programmers".  I made this list for myself to drop into any new project I start for learning a language or framework.

I highly recommend buying the book, the information provided in the first chapter is quite valuable and provides a solid foundation for tackling each exercise.

## How to Use

I recommend cloning this file and replace "Programming" at the top with the language or framework the exercises will be made with.  Next, wherever an exercise is made (separate files usually), copy the "Process" section into each exercise file to be filled out before attempting to do the exercise.

Also, make sure to track each exercise as a branch with Git.  After each exercise is done and merged into master, notes.md should gradually grow and be useful for the next exercise.

## The Process

The first chapter of the book goes over a loose process to follow for each exercise.  I've converted that chapter into a checklist to put in each exercise file & notes.

- [ ] **Problem Statement**: *Remember to ask a few questions to clarify what is needed*
- [ ] **Inputs, Processes, and Outputs**: *Remember to pull nouns and verbs from problem statement to find data and actions*
- [ ] **Test(s)**: *Design at least 1 test, remember to consider expected vs actual input and output*
- [ ] **Algorithm Pseudocode**: *Step by step set of instructions written in your language, not code to review application process*
- [ ] **Write the Code!** *Remember to not tackle challenges right away, that's what refactoring and branches are for*
- [ ] **Challenges**: *With first version of the program finished, try to complete challenges and features incrementally, remember to repeat the steps above in order*

# dsthedev's docs

This is a personal collection of notes on how I set things up, from software installation to process outlines.

## How to use

If you're me, read and follow these guides.

If you're not me, read and follow at your own discretion.  These are my personal notes.  I made them public only to make sharing specific docs with people easier.

## How to edit

Use git to manage and Typora to edit markdown files.

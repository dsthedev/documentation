# dsthedev's docs

This is a personal collection of notes on how I set things up, from software installation to process outlines.

## How to use

If you're me:

`mkdir ~/projects/; cd ~/projects/; git clone https://github.com/dsthedev/documentation.git`

Then read and follow the installed guides.

If you're not me, read and follow at your own discretion.  These are my personal notes.  Issue's and PR's are likely to be discarded unless a discussion is initiated beforehand.

## How to edit

Use git to manage and VSCode to edit markdown files.  Use Typora for a better copy/paste experience from the web.

## Other Stuff

Current monitor layout is `|-- / PLL`

`Code | App | Browse`

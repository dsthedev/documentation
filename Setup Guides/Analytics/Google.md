# Google Analytics Setup Guide

This was essentially cloned from Google's little help icon / sidebar.  I wanted to have it in markdown format for various reasons so I copied their steps & links and edited / formatted it a little bit.

## Setup

1. Create or sign in to your Analytics account:
   - Go to [google.com/analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
   - Do one of the following:
     - To create an account, click **Start for free**.
     - To sign in to your account, Click **Sign in to Analytics**.
2. [Set up a property in your Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508). A property represents your website or app, and is the collection point in Analytics for the data from your site or app.
3. [Set up a reporting view in your property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009714). Views let you create filtered perspectives of your data; for example, all data except from your companyâ€™s internal IP addresses, or all data associated with a specific sales region.
4. Follow the instructions to add the tracking code to your [website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080)so you can collect data in your Analytics property.

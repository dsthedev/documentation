# Installing OBS

OBS is a fantastic tool for recording videos, adding overlays, and controlling inputs for screencasts.

## Windows Install

1. Download the latest Windows Version of OBS
2. Run the installer
	* **Tip:** If running multiple drives, make sure to install it on an appropriate drive.  I put it on my SSD C:/ drive to maximize performance of the application.
	* Default settings should be fine, but make sure to read each step thoroughly!
3. Move onto configuring OBS
